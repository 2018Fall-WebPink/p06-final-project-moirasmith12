            <!--paragraph with background info and 2 links-->
            <p>Mary Jackson was born in Hampton, VA in 1921, during a time of racial segregation. Right away, she excelled academically, specifically in the math and science fields. Her acadamic excellence soon earned her the postition of <a href="https://www.biography.com/people/mary-winston-jackson-120616">"human computer"</a> for NASA. Of course, that was after earning dual bachelor's degrees, mathematics and physical science, from <a href="https://www.virginiahistory.org/collections-and-resources/virginia-history-explorer/civil-rights-movement-virginia/hampton-institute">Hampton Institute.</a>  </p>
          
            <!--paragraph of how she inspired with no links-->
            <p> Her accomplishments are truly amazing for any person, but during this time, Mary Jackson wasn't just a normal person. She was an African American woman. While working for NASA, she certainly encountered the effects of segregation, like having to eat at her desk, or going to a "colored" bathroom. After dealing with these unfair accomadations for several months, Jackson was having enough and considered stepping down from her position. That's when she had a "chance encounter" with a supervisor, who, after hearing Jackson's complaints, saw her potential and hired her to work for him. After taking engineering classes, Jackson was promoted to NASA's first black female engineer. She paved the way for others to follow, and because of her courage and strength in tough times, she inspires so many each and every day. </p>

            <p>The film was nominated for 3 awards at the Academy Awards, and won 4 at the African-American Film Critics Association. The 3 inspiring women, Dorothy Vaughan, Katherine Johnson, and Mary Jackson, of course, gained much more attention for their amazing work for NASA. </p>
